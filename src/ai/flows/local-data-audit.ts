 * @fileOverview This file is reserved for future AI-powered data auditing features.

// This file is intentionally left sparse. The logic-based audit is handled client-side.
// It can be expanded later with more advanced AI checks, such as anomaly detection
// in trading patterns, which would be a true use case for a Genkit flow.
